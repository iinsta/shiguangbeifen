    <p>Look what people say first:</p>
    <p>
      A: We've been using the app named PEEKABOO MOMENTS for a long time now,
      we're paying customers. "VIP" customers, as they call it. Before, they
      used to let you download all of your content as a local backup; photos and
      texts. Recently, I've noticed the backup function is GONE. Nowhere to be
      found. I contacted them, and they say the function is removed. REMOVED,
      yes. Uhhh... so... we're paying customers. "VIP" means we're "Very
      Important" I thought? Does anyone know if "VIP" has alternate meanings?
      Like "To Be F-ed With"? Because this isn't how I expect to be treated as a
      paying customer. If anyone has a backup workaround, knows how to access
      the Amazon file storage behind Peekaboo Moments, please share! But
      actually I'm not so sure this is possible. So I guess this is just a
      warning to

      B: We use peekaboomoments.com for almost a year now. It's a great app, but
      I encountered limitations when I make backups. The people behind Peekaboo
      Moments are also not responding to questions. Because all the diary
      entries you write + all the photos and movies you upload end up 'in the
      cloud' and amounts to a lot of data, it's important to download backups
      every now and then. This is the user's responsibility, and so I do that.
      Photos and video's are all there as the original (jpg) photo and movie
      files. Text content (diary entries) goes into a single large .json file,
      an open format. Seems good so far, right? Recently I found out that the
      .json file doesn't contain photo comments. So a large amount of written
      content is out in the cloud, and we're unable to back it up. I don't like
      that. Does anyone else have this problem? Is this a vendor lock-in thing?
      (i.e. similar to Facebook not allowing you to download your entire profile
      content) I couldn't find anything about this
    </p>

    <p>There are many...</p>
